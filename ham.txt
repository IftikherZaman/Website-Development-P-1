                                <p>  I am an international student from Bangladesh. I started my undergraduate journey at UofT in Fall 2022 as a recipient of UofT Engineering's "International Scholar Award."<br> My biggest strength, if I have to name one, is my ability to absorb the admirable qualities of the people around me and replicate them in my behavior. Whatever I am now is the accumulation of all those traits that I have replicated from people at different spheres of my life journey. 

                                    My biggest fear is oblivion. One of the reasons behind choosing engineering was to make a sustainable impact on the people around me and leave an impression beyond my presence. <br> My biggest daily challenge is waking up early, as being a night owl, I often find my peak productivity at night. 
                                    
                                   <br> In terms of leisure, I am a die-hard Manchester United fan. I love being a part of team sports and the competition in them. I am also a cinephile and have watched all kinds of classics, from Alfred Hitchcock thrillers to Stanley Kubrick films.
